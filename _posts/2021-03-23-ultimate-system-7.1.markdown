Macintosh System 7.1.x was a lean and versatile system back in the day. It runs on the Mac Plus to early PowerPC’s. It's low memory footprint and ability to run almost all System 7 software make it a great choice for your vintage Mac. 

In this post I’ll show you how to customize your 7.1 install to run anything System 7.6.1 could software – and even look like MacOS 8 if you so choose.

## Modern networking

MacTCP is the bane of many vintage mac users as it’s difficult to understand and configure. If you have an 030 and over 4MB of RAM you can install Open Transport 1.3 to get a more modern TCP/IP configuration.
