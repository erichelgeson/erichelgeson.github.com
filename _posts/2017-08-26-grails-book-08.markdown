## A living book

Please note when you purchase Practical Grails 3 you will receive update through the whole life of Grails 3.x. The book will continue to grow with new features and feedback as Grails grows.

## A note on Grails 3.3.x

I've been tracking changes to the 3.3.x line though have not updated the book examples yet. The main reason is the build-test-data plugin has not been updated yet to support 3.3.x. We use build-test-data extensively in the examples. Due to this the 1.0 release of the book will be on the latest 3.2.x line.

I am considering moving all build-data related tasks to [dru](https://github.com/agorapulse/dru) and the new trait testing framework. I would love to hear your feedback on this change.

Note: **0.7** release was a silent release live on the site since June 22nd 2017.

Thanks!
