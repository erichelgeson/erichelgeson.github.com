## Living Book

The 1.0 release is not the end - it's the beginning! I have been working on the 3.3.x branch updates for a while but there is so much new I wanted the 1.0 to be based off Grails 3.2.
Please note when you purchase Practical Grails 3 you will receive update through the whole life of Grails 3.x.

The book will continue to grow with new features and feedback as Grails grows.

## Planned for 1.1

* Grails 3.3.x
* Data Services
* GraphQL intro
* More deployment scenarios
* Feedback from you!

## G3 Summit

I had a great time at the G3 Summit this year - check out my recap blog post!
